1
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,439
Hello everyone. Surprise for anyone

2
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,560
who's tuning in. So, it's been a wild

3
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,159
couple of days. Um, Ralph is finally

4
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,640
crossing the chasm and people are

5
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
realizing that the economics of software

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,759
development has

7
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,400
forever changed. Um, if you run uh what

8
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,200
I'm about to show you in a loop. What

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,080
happens is you work out a unit economic

10
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,280
cost for software development.

11
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,479
Note there is a difference between

12
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,960
software development and software

13
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,720
engineering. Software engineering is

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,880
some of the stuff we'll be doing here

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,400
later as I expand some of these

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,520
teachings.

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,799
And essentially software development now

18
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,680
costs $1042 US an hour. It's uh less

19
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,320
than uh you would pay a fast

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:57,040
fast food retail worker. It's cheap.

21
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,960
It's now cheap. And not only is it

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,799
cheap, you can do it autonomously.

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,680
But to get it working, you have to

24
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,039
understand the bare bones fundamentals

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,239
from first principles. Like don't start

26
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,640
with a jackhammer like Ralph. Like learn

27
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,640
how to use a screwdriver first. Learn

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
how to use a screwdriver first. Really

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,720
important. just don't jump straight to

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,520
the power tools.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
And yeah, so the calculations of $1042

32
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,800
an hour is really simple. If you take

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,480
API costs for

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
uh Sonnet 4.5 from Enthropic right now

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,800
and you run Ralph in a loop and you look

36
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,800
at how much it costs in a 24-hour

37
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,360
period, you're looking at $1042 an hour.

38
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
And in that you're not out in a single

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,560
hour you're outputting multiple days

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,519
worth of work if not weeks levels of

41
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,760
work. So in 24 hours you're you're

42
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,640
actually at a place where you're mogging

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,239
like backlogs type thing. So it gets

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,480
really strange for what's going to be

45
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,599
happening in our industry going forward

46
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,599
because if you look at it right

47
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,239
essentially

48
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,599
um it's going to create this rift

49
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,040
something I've been talking about over

50
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,720
the last There's going to be this

51
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
massive rift in software development

52
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
between those who get it and those who

53
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,519
don't. And I've been pleading with

54
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
people, please invest in yourselves, get

55
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,000
curious, pick up the screwdriver, master

56
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,000
the screwdriver. Once you know the

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
screwdriver, go for the jackhammer.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,200
Thanks, uh, Dex for the analogy. So,

59
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,080
let's kick this off. Let's kick this

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,560
off.

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,159
So um one of the most fundamental things

62
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,400
is you need to have your specifications.

63
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,080
It doesn't matter about the tool that

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,040
you use, the coding harness or what else

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,440
have you. It's it's more about thinking

66
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,840
about this from first principles. It's

67
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,120
all about from first principles.

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,599
Anthropic has released their plugin that

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,200
does Ralph and I'm thankful for that

70
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,640
because it's just created this

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,360
inflection point. But the way that that

72
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,920
works is uh not not it. You're going to

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,680
get better outcomes if you do these

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,000
concepts by hand. This is the

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,760
screwdriver. Now, if you give me a

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,759
moment, it looks like my Roomba is

77
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,680
kicking off, which is kind of hilarious

78
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,720
considering we're about to program a

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,720
Roomba. So, give me a check.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,360
There we go. All right. So, the physical

81
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,240
room is done. Let's do the virtual room.

82
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,479
So, here is Loom. Loom is where I'm kind

83
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,360
of reimagining what software development

84
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,560
will be, what we need to throw away.

85
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:55,120
Everything that exists today

86
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,320
is all been designed for humans. If you

87
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,800
think about the user space in Unix,

88
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
that's all we've got TTY and all that

89
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,800
stuff. That's everything has been

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,840
compounding on a design for humans for

91
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,680
humans for humans. Even agile and how we

92
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,680
do software development and all the rest

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,479
of the engineering practices, it's all

94
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,759
been designed around humans. So if you

95
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,240
go in a loop of essentially invalidating

96
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,000
uh was this designed for humans, you can

97
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,919
do like the five W's and maybe you're

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
able to cut it. And if you're able to

99
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,600
cut it, you need then need to think

100
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,360
about okay, how do I mitigate cutting

101
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,520
that? Was it adding value? Was it not

102
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,440
adding value?

103
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,840
And this is what Loom is. Loom is an

104
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,000
experiment in essentially

105
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:45,120
self-evolutionary software. It's uh the

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,440
idea is if instead of having humans

107
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,160
in the loop,

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,960
what happens if humans instead are on

109
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,880
the loop or programming the loop?

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,199
And that's going to require a heavy

111
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,720
engineering mindset.

112
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,759
Um, and this is going to be very

113
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,919
different to software development

114
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
because software development is now

115
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,840
fundamentally automated with the most

116
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:10,560
trivial of bash loops and techniques.

117
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,120
And uh, this is just the start. Um, this

118
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,560
is going to cause an inspiration for

119
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,360
other people to build their own things

120
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,800
that are smarter than Ralph.

121
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,400
Smarter than Ralph. I'm already seeing

122
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,880
that taking place.

123
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,880
So, Loom is of many things right now.

124
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,600
Loom is uh essentially GitHub code

125
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,199
hosting. It's its own source control

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,960
that uses JJ. It's GitHub code spaces.

127
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
So, I can remotely provision

128
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,479
infrastructure.

129
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:48,960
Um, it's got its own coding agent very

130
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,280
similar to AMP or Claude code. um except

131
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
that it alloys multiple different LLM

132
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,400
providers together

133
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,880
and it has the ability to

134
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,199
spawn remote infrastructure and run not

135
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,639
locally on the computer

136
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,400
and I'm very much building in a actor

137
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,199
pub sub type of mind where I want to be

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:15,120
looking at creating chains of these

139
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,560
agents or creating loops on loops on

140
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,720
loops on Ralph and it extends way past

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,440
software development. It crosses into

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,120
the feature space or the product design

143
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,680
space. Last night I added uh essentially

144
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,000
feature flags or feature experiments uh

145
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,880
by giving some prompts to essentially

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,360
hey we want to clone launch darkly and

147
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,599
we've got it now. So, the next thing

148
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,759
really is, okay, I I'm missing some

149
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,680
analytics and I've got this SAS company

150
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,160
that wants to charge me $900 of $900 to

151
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,080
renew and it's such a simple product and

152
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
I'm going to need this functionality in

153
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,879
Loom

154
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,879
if I want to take Ralph to the to the

155
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,639
product access. And that's something I

156
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,840
do want to do. I want autonomous agents.

157
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,840
I call them weavers that autonomously

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,080
deploy

159
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,479
software without any code review. It's

160
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,800
already it's already doing it now.

161
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,639
There's been so many failure domains. I

162
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
can probably hear your objections. If

163
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,039
Ralph the idea of running Ralph makes

164
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
you want a Ralph, listen to it.

165
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,720
Listen to it and then engineer away

166
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,400
those concerns. That is now the job.

167
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,280
That is now our job as software

168
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,520
engineers is to keep the locomotive on

169
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,599
the track. We are locomotive engineers

170
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,120
now.

171
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,200
We're no long we're no longer carrying

172
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:44,159
cargo by hand onto the ship. We have the

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,959
uh the box the boxes here. Um the

174
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,640
shipping containers are here. So Loom is

175
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:53,360
of many things. Um the way that Loom was

176
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,320
built is really simple.

177
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,440
It starts with a conversation

178
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
and the conversation creates specs.

179
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,399
The conversation creates specs. I see a

180
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:08,560
lot of people out there saying, "Hey, I

181
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,320
want to uh do like they handcraft their

182
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,399
specs and they say they don't have time

183
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,880
to create specs." No. Would you believe

184
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,160
I don't create my specs. I generate

185
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,399
them. Then I review them and edit them

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,279
by hand. And then I just let it rip with

187
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,160
Ralph. So let's do this now. Like I've

188
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,360
got this SAS analytics company. I'm

189
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,399
going to need analytics because I want

190
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,959
my Weavers to be able to look at product

191
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,320
metrics. I've got the ability for

192
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,640
feature experiments to turn

193
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,040
functionality on and off. And I'm

194
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,080
engineering in a way that there is no

195
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,760
code review. We have autonomous software

196
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,839
or agents or weavers that will

197
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,360
automatically when it's introducing a

198
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:58,880
feature put a feature flag in

199
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,640
deploy it look at the analytics decide

200
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,880
whether it's actually fixed any errors

201
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,200
or maybe it can do some optimizations

202
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,839
and the landing page this is where we're

203
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
going folks this is 2026 strap yourself

204
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,480
in where we're getting towards

205
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,959
essentially autonomous systems

206
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
um Ralph is really just a malicking

207
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,920
orchestrator

208
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,200
that avoids context rot and compaction.

209
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Compaction is the is the devil

210
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,279
that basically considers the entire

211
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:32,160
system including the operating system as

212
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,399
the complete unit. If you have some

213
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:37,279
external functionality like some

214
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,440
external vendor or API or whatever that

215
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,920
is also part of the system. It's not

216
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,320
just your application. Now, a lot of

217
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,160
those external systems that exist today

218
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
that we use in software engineering have

219
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
been designed for humans.

220
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,120
You might see me on a loop about this.

221
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,600
So,

222
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,399
what would they look like if they were

223
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,800
designed for robots and how can we

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
change that design so they're designed

225
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,760
for robots? If we control the entire

226
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,560
stack, then we can start doing

227
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,920
optimization like serialization formats.

228
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
JSON is not a great uh protocol when it

229
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,440
comes to uh serialization and

230
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,600
tokenization. It's not a great protocol.

231
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,800
If we control the entire stack, then we

232
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,360
can improve how tokenization works to

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,519
drive these reactive agents and all of a

234
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,600
sudden you can now operate cheaper

235
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,079
than anyone else because you're

236
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,079
optimizing. Like we need to be thinking

237
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,200
about software engineering again. We got

238
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,360
a brand new computer. What is something

239
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,640
from something?

240
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,279
Like for example, what is garbage

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,680
collection now? What is Malo? What is

242
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,360
Erlang? OTP principles and message

243
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,240
passing.

244
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,839
Why do we have user space?

245
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,160
Like and all these things. Why do we

246
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
have JSON? Why do we have TTY? And you

247
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,680
start just cutting and start optimizing

248
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,040
just to be the bare minimum that the

249
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:07,680
machine needs. So let's go folks. Today

250
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:11,800
we're going to

251
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,800
show you how you create specs.

252
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Going to kick off cla code. Claw code's

253
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,320
going to do its thing. yada yada yada.

254
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
So the first thing you want to do and

255
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,920
one of the first principles of Ralph is

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,800
essentially deterministically malicking

257
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,040
the array. Context windows are arrays.

258
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,120
The less that you use in that array, the

259
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,279
less the window needs to slide, the

260
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
better outcomes you get. very much

261
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
different to the anthropic which

262
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,800
basically just completely keeps pounding

263
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
the model in a loop until it gets

264
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,680
compaction and then the compaction is a

265
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,839
lossy function and then it can result in

266
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:52,120
the loss of the the the pin and what I

267
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,120
call the pin is this

268
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,760
I've been incrementally building up loom

269
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,600
through conversations just like this and

270
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,839
this is my specifications and every time

271
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,959
I add a new feature or adjust I

272
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,399
continually continually evolve and

273
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:09,200
update my specifications.

274
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,079
And cool, this is now my pin. It's got

275
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,880
my frame of reference of what this is

276
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,200
all about. And I haven't injected it

277
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,360
all. But what I've done, if I look at

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,440
this file, is it's a whole bunch of

279
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,639
lookup tables that link to a particular

280
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,360
things and give hints to the search tool

281
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,440
for like user authentication. and what

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
are some other words used for user

283
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,720
authentication which improves the hit

284
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,959
rate of the search tool. The more it's

285
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,279
able to find and look up that context,

286
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,920
the less it's going to invent. I don't

287
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,760
want it to invent anything to do with my

288
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,079
current functionality, but I do want to

289
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,560
use it as a pin or frame or reference to

290
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,560
my current functionality.

291
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Okay, let's go. So, how do you build

292
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:02,079
specs? It's really simple. Hey, I want

293
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:07,040
to add product analytics

294
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,040
like post hog into

295
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,040
uh loom.

296
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,440
It

297
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,040
would be used uh

298
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,360
by products built

299
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,360
on loom.

300
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,120
Thus we are collecting information about

301
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,040
non

302
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,120
uh authenticated

303
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:40,040
users. Let's have a discussion

304
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,040
and you can interview me.

305
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,600
So we got our pin which basically you

306
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,199
can use as a lookup source to learn more

307
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,199
about the current functionality of the

308
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,199
application.

309
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,079
And then I just go like four four point

310
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,800
four. I don't care about privacy. We

311
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:05,360
collect

312
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:08,959
data. Use the loom secret

313
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,800
create for IP addresses. So this is

314
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,040
something I've got. I've got a a special

315
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:18,399
wrapper for PII type topics. That way

316
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,959
logs for sensitive PII information will

317
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,120
never end up any anything like IP

318
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,959
addresses and all that stuff will never

319
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,800
end up in logs. This is the engineering

320
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,360
type topic. So I'm giving it some some

321
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,199
direction. Later I'll play with the

322
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,279
privacy etc. And this is really low

323
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,880
effort just to teach people how simple

324
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:42,600
it is. uh five

325
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,600
integration is via web

326
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:52,040
uh API thus clients will be

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,040
uh the clients will be

328
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:01,519
rust typescript and interact with the

329
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,560
loom api.

330
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,240
Next up, I guess we need SDKs for this

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,959
new

332
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,320
feature set.

333
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,079
So, other applications

334
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,079
can run experiments on the Loom

335
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,079
platform.

336
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,560
And this is it's a dance and dance in

337
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,560
and out.

338
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,120
I don't want any uh like mobile. So I'm

339
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:51,519
going to say no mobile event model event

340
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,040
model choose best practices. Look how

341
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,680
post

342
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:02,560
does it. Three,

343
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:06,720
four, experiments integrate in with our

344
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:11,319
existing flag

345
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,319
specifications and system.

346
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:21,280
Fine. For data storage, just store in

347
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,199
our current

348
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
SQL light. Right now I'm using SQL light

349
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,280
because it's just really fast for

350
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,960
iteration loop versus Postgress. Plus

351
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,120
you get these machines that are massive

352
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
now. They're really cheap. You can fogg

353
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,559
a postgress database so hard these days.

354
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,880
And uh whilst this is not scalable,

355
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,440
that's not a concern I have right now.

356
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,760
Um and in the end I'm not locking in my

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,520
data model because I have a vision

358
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,400
towards actors and OTP principles. Um

359
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,559
maybe I can merge multiple of these big

360
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
machines together and we start getting

361
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,880
towards virtual actors and Microsoft all

362
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:02,440
things. If you know you know

363
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,440
okay identity

364
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:13,760
identity model I don't know how does

365
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,400
post hog do it let's discuss.

366
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,960
So this is think about this is about

367
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,120
you've got some clay on a pottery wheel

368
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,280
and you're just like slowly making

369
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,440
adjustments. You're you're molding the

370
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
context window and you're testing what

371
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,440
it knows and you're applying the

372
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,080
engineering knowledge that you have

373
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,799
and we're shaping the specifications.

374
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,799
We're shaping the specifications.

375
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,880
And it's a dance, folks. This is how you

376
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,960
build your specifications. You got all

377
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,600
the time in the world. And what's really

378
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,320
cool is I could let this rip once it's

379
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:02,880
done in a branch, and then I could like

380
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,960
check its outcomes. It's free. It's

381
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,200
pretty much free. I think it's like let

382
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,120
it do a couple Ralph loops while I'm

383
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,880
there

384
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,320
and I would I'd be driving it by hand.

385
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,840
I'll be malicking and doing the

386
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,120
principles by hand. And if I'm okay

387
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,120
where it's it's going, then I will just

388
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
let it rip. Otherwise, if something's

389
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,840
wrong, I'll go back to the

390
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
specifications.

391
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,640
I will adjust some of the prompt

392
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,640
engineering. Maybe I take some different

393
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,760
approaches for the back pressure.

394
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,600
There's a lot of things you can do with

395
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,840
back pressure. Our job is now

396
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,840
engineering back pressure to the

397
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,000
generative function to keep the

398
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,880
generative function on the rails, the

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,880
locomotive.

400
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,880
Um

401
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:03,280
yeah, we want person profiles inc

402
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:07,840
anonymous and SDK can identify someone.

403
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know what does post hogg do

404
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,559
three

405
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,280
uh

406
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,280
multi- tannency

407
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:23,600
ty

408
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:29,799
works by analytics

409
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,799
uh tied to a loom or

410
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,159
they're tied to a loom organization I've

411
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,960
already got aback back. I've already got

412
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,280
multi-tenency built in. So, this is me

413
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,480
applying the engineering that you should

414
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,960
use the search tool to uh learn how like

415
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,120
I'm already doing multi-tenency.

416
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
This is me steering the specification

417
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,240
stage or adjusting the clay and the

418
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,320
pottery wheel that you got to use the

419
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,320
search tool. Don't reinvent yourself

420
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
here.

421
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,799
And the interesting thing is because

422
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,200
it's the context window is just an

423
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,799
array. There's no reason why you can't

424
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,880
like productize just this process. Um

425
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,200
even Anthropics doing it like the user

426
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,360
ask question tool or the planning tool

427
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
etc. But that's not good enough because

428
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,400
there's no memory server side for

429
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,039
inferencing. It's just what's in the RA.

430
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,919
There's no reason why you can't preserve

431
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,080
this conversation and rehydrate it

432
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,159
later. So, you can either create another

433
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,440
terminal once you write it out to disk,

434
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
and we're going to be doing that very

435
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,799
shortly,

436
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:04,000
and then let it rip uh attended, and

437
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,679
then let it rip unattended,

438
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
and then come back here and make some

439
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,559
adjustments before you let it go. a full

440
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,200
hog or like you can make some sort of

441
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:16,080
tool here that just like resumes this

442
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,000
type of state resumes the state of the

443
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,960
conversation. So you can resume the

444
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,600
planning. There's no reason why the

445
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,919
source of truth needs to be marked down

446
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,919
folks. It can be just this array.

447
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,919
Um

448
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:46,480
Just do what post hog does.

449
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:50,880
Okay. Then update specar.md

450
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:53,520
and create a implementation plan at

451
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,280
hostth hog.mmd.

452
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,520
And this is the key is if you want to

453
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,240
improve the ability for it to track the

454
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,799
plan. I've seen people go JSON and other

455
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,880
JSON etc. All you need to do is think

456
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,480
about like the generative function into

457
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,400
the search tool.

458
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,120
strong linkage. You just got to do

459
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:16,520
linkage

460
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,520
and as bullet points

461
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:24,480
and site the specification or source

462
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:27,480
code that needs to be adjusted

463
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,480
specification.

464
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,919
And then you can you can start really

465
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,000
playing with this because like the way

466
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:41,039
that the read tool works is it works in

467
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,880
hunks, folks. It works in hunks. So you

468
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,960
can actually tell it to actually give

469
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,640
specifics of what hunks in each file

470
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,559
need to be done. I'm not going to do it

471
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,480
here. I just need to let this rip. I've

472
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,840
got about seven minutes to get this

473
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,840
going and then I'm going to be AFK.

474
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,919
Okay, let's call out something that's

475
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
happening here. It's creating the new

476
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,919
specification, but not only is it

477
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,240
creating the new specification, it's

478
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:27,240
updating my lookup table. The specs

479
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,240
readme,

480
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,440
it's updating the specs dot the lookup

481
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,760
table. It's just a lookup table.

482
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,480
And it has many different generative

483
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,120
words to explain

484
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,640
what each spec does. And those

485
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,559
generative words act as essentially by

486
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,679
having more descriptors of what the

487
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,200
specification is. That lookup table will

488
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:54,480
get more hits for the search tool.

489
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,240
You need to think about these things

490
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,080
from first principles because you can

491
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,720
drive it all by hand. The more you drive

492
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
by hand, the better outcomes you get. If

493
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,760
you go straight for the jackham

494
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,520
jackhammer, you're going to get terrible

495
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,520
results. Absolutely terrible results.

496
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,559
All righty, we now got a specification.

497
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,279
Now, it would be really tempting to kick

498
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,120
this off in this context window, but

499
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,600
this context window or this array

500
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,000
already has one goal. That's to create

501
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
me some specifications.

502
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,399
Now, there's a thing of context rot.

503
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:46,559
This is what Ralph is all about is

504
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:51,919
avoiding compaction by deterministically

505
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:53,600
malicking the array. So question time.

506
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,320
It should be no surprise what we need to

507
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,760
do is create a new array.

508
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,960
We're going to keep this one open. We're

509
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,720
going to have a look to see what it

510
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,559
does, right? Because I might want to

511
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:06,159
refine my specifications. So I'm just

512
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:09,640
going to like create another session.

513
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,640
Hop on over.

514
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,679
Cool. And we're going to go to code, go

515
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,240
to Loom.

516
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,279
And the first thing we're going to do is

517
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
create a prompt.

518
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,600
Prompt of MD.

519
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,320
Okay, we need our PIN study

520
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,240
specs readme.md.

521
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,679
Study. What is this called? It's called

522
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,679
the specs implementation plan.

523
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,399
and pick the most important thing to do.

524
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,480
So instead of this multi-step type of

525
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,399
approach, what we're doing is we're

526
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
allowing the LLM to decide what the most

527
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,720
important thing is in our implementation

528
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,440
plan.

529
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,919
It's uh you you it's not high control,

530
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:01,840
it's low control with high oversight.

531
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,200
And by it only just doing one thing in

532
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,200
lots of loops, then each loop only has

533
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,760
one goal, one objective, and you you're

534
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:15,240
using less of the context window, folks.

535
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,240
Very important. Okay. Important.

536
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,159
Entropic likes you to yell at the LM.

537
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,279
Let's give us some completion promises

538
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:29,120
or give us give some objectives. It's

539
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:38,080
important. uh

540
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:40,960
use the loom web i18 where uh and loom

541
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,720
for typescript

542
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,720
and I will just say this is like loom

543
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,720
18n

544
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,080
patterns for typescript

545
00:31:51,840 --> 00:32:00,720
or the loom iain n patterns for rust.

546
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,279
Okay.

547
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,279
Uh build

548
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:12,559
author property based tests

549
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:15,600
or unit tests whichever is best. I'm

550
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,799
giving the judgment to the LLM to decide

551
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,039
whether it should be a property based

552
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,039
test or unit test. I'm not going to get

553
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,399
into that dogma of where you should use

554
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,960
each. This is your engineering

555
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:30,679
knowledge.

556
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,679
After making chain, after make

557
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:39,399
run cargo test

558
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,080
run

559
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,159
the tests.

560
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:55,440
When tests pass, commit and push to

561
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:59,039
deploy the changes. Now, Loom

562
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,200
automatically deploys. There is no CI.

563
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:06,559
There is no CI. Um, it has full access

564
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,960
to do pseudo. It's been programmed in

565
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,880
loops. So, it can introspect the

566
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,679
automatic deployment using pseudo. And

567
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,240
pseudo is very safe in this case for

568
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:20,960
bootstrapping up because uh I use Nixos.

569
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,120
And if you know, you know.

570
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,440
Now, I'm kind of halfassing this to be

571
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,039
honest. Um because I'm depressed on

572
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,399
time,

573
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,679
you normally would do something a little

574
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,880
bit better. So I'm just going to kick

575
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,919
this off while true. Let's do the Ralph

576
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:41,679
cat prompt. MD

577
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:46,240
to claude dangerously skip permissions.

578
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:49,240
Done. And no matter typo while true

579
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,240
do

580
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Cool.

581
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,919
We're now doing the Rap Wigum. While

582
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,840
true, we're deterministically malicking

583
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,919
the harness or the or harness. And in

584
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,679
the bigger picture of this, Loom is the

585
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,839
thing that actually deterministically

586
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:13,280
malics or is the Ralph loop. And it's

587
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,000
running many Ralph loops and they're

588
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:19,280
chain reactive as as much as need be

589
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,200
like Erlang style.

590
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,280
And uh it is

591
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,280
uh let me just check. I think I made a

592
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,200
mistake here. So this is the idea. You

593
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,440
don't have to immediately go into full

594
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,800
blown raft.

595
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:39,760
You can do it attended. I forgot to

596
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:44,399
update the implementation plan when the

597
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,480
task is done. Y.

598
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,599
Cool.

599
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,000
And this sets up our state checkpoints.

600
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,839
Let's kick off Ralph again. So, this is

601
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,320
the practice backwards, forwards. You

602
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,400
like you don't just let it rip. You you

603
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,240
you watch this. Well, you're watching

604
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,520
it. I'll call out anything that I notice

605
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,280
that's a little bit weird and I'll

606
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,240
cancel this. I'll go back and adjust my

607
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,000
prompt. Maybe this was a little bit more

608
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,839
effort. I would like inspect the code to

609
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,320
make sure it's following conventions.

610
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,000
But like for me, at least with Loom, it

611
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,280
really doesn't matter if it outputs

612
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,440
something bad because I would just sit

613
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,599
down there with a highlighter and have a

614
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,880
look what if it's bad. And that's just

615
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,640
another Ralph loop to pull and curate

616
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,320
and refactor the codebase to follow

617
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,800
conventions. If if it gets

618
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,480
internationalization,

619
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,560
I would just that's just a raph loop to

620
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,520
force it to do that. If it doesn't use

621
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,920
aback uh for security, that's just

622
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,079
another RA loop. It's just different

623
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,079
techniques of the RA loop to automate

624
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,440
things. So, this is now running. So,

625
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,040
let's just kick off some music. I'm

626
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,119
going to go AFK and uh gonna go out

627
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,720
tonight. So, cheers folks. Thanks for

628
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,079
tuning in. I hope this answers a lot of

629
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:01,040
questions.

630
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,880
Um it is you got to approach this from

631
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,880
first level's principles and you can do

632
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:12,280
Ralph by hand because it's all about

633
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,280
deterministically malicking the array.
